# Prasis

**Prasis** is a student project developed as part of the frontend curriculum at Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media.

The goal of the project is to create a simple auction platform where users can:
- Register using a `@stud.noroff.no` email address
- Log in and log out
- View and update their profile (avatar and credit balance)
- Create listings with title, description, image(s), and deadline
- Place bids on other usersâ€™ listings
- Browse and search all listings

The application uses the [Noroff Auction API](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2/auction-house/listings) for all data transactions.
