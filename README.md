## Description

**Prasis** is a simple auction website built as part of the frontend curriculum at **Noroff – School of Technology and Digital Media**.  
This project is delivered as **Semester Project 2**, where the goal is to demonstrate skills in HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, API integration, and project planning.

The application allows registered users to create auction listings, place bids, and manage their profile – while unregistered users can still browse and search listings.

The name **Prasis** comes from the Greek word meaning _auction_.

## Credits 🎉

This project was built by me with the help of **ChatGPT** and **DeepSeek**,  
which assisted with **JSDoc comments**, **code comments**, **debugging typos**, and overall **learning process** throughout the project.

A special thanks to my **girlfriend**, who took care of our dog and two cats, and handled more housework so that I had the time to complete this project.
